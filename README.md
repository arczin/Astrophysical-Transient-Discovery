# Astrophysical-Transient-Discovery

Focused on the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, which generates nearly 10 million nightly alerts from sky surveys. Traditional supervised ML methods are limited to pre-labelled classes, while this approach explores unsupervised AI/ML models to automatically detect anomalies and flag novel or rare astrophysical transients.
