# Astrophysical-Transient-Discovery

Focused on the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, which generates nearly 10 million nightly alerts from sky surveys. Traditional supervised ML methods are limited to pre-labelled classes, while this approach explores unsupervised AI/ML models to automatically detect anomalies and flag novel or rare astrophysical transients.

The focus is on early-stage data preparation, anomaly scoring methods, and 
compact representations that work even when labelled examples are limited.

## Motivation

Traditional supervised pipelines depend on training classes defined in advance.  
But LSST’s data volume makes it likely that:

- some transients will not match known categories,
- rare events will be underrepresented in training sets,
- some outliers may be scientifically interesting

This project builds the foundations for an **unsupervised or semi-supervised** model.
